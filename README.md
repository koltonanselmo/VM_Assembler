# VM_Assembler
Virtual Machine and Assembler written in c++ to accept my own assembly language.

This is a reporsitory for my assembler and virtual machine written in C++. For demonstration purposes this repository has a C program called "C_program.c" this program is written in assembley for this VM/Assembler in the file "simulateCProgram.asm". When this file is passed into the source C++ program on the command line it will duplicate the capabilities of the C program. The C program is there to make it easier to see what the assembley program is doing.
